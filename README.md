# Market-Prediction-with-ML

## Overview
This project aims to predict financial market trends using Machine Learning models. Based on the concepts from *Python for Algorithmic Trading* by Yves Hilpisch, we utilize historical market data, technical indicators, and supervised learning algorithms to forecast stock price movements. The models aim to identify patterns in price fluctuations and predict short-term price changes, making it useful for algorithmic trading strategies.

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop machine learning models that can:
- Predict price movements for financial assets (stocks, ETFs, etc.).
- Incorporate a wide range of features including past price trends and technical indicators.
- Provide reliable, real-time predictions to support trading decisions.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Processing:**
  - Historical stock prices are sourced using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
  - Data preprocessing involves cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Technical indicators like Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Volatility are calculated to provide insights into the market's conditions.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - We implement a variety of models, including:
    - **Random Forest**: For robust predictions based on ensemble learning.
    - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For classification of price movement trends.
    - **XGBoost**: For high-performance boosting-based predictions.
  
- **Backtesting:**
  - Backtest models using historical data to evaluate performance.
  - Metrics like accuracy, F1-score, Sharpe ratio, and confusion matrices are used to measure prediction performance and financial viability.
